# About the project

*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your GitHub repository here. This is an R Markdown (.Rmd) file so you should use R Markdown syntax.*

```{r}
# This is a so-called "R chunk" where you can write R code.

date()
today<-Sys.Date()
print("Do we need code here?")
print("what is date?")
print("Is it?") 
today
```
The text continues here.

I have high expectations for this course. I want to learn data stat and visualization tools.
I would like to learn and start routine use of Markdown. I am using simple build-in functions 
to manipulate data during my working process, but functions and etc. not often used.
First workshop was nice, same as guidelines how to install soft. I could not solve issue with my Valti computer, so I am using home MAC.
Could Markdown actually check spelling? Do you know?
