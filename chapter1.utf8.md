# About the project


I have high expectations for this course. I want to learn data stat and visualization tools.
I would like to learn and start routine use of Markdown. I am using simple build-in functions 
to manipulate data during my working process, but functions and etc. not often used.
First workshop was nice, same as guidelines how to install soft. I could not solve issue with my Valti computer, so I am using home MAC.
Could Markdown actually check spelling? Do you know?

```r
# This is a so-called "R chunk" where you can write R code.

date()
```

```
## [1] "Mon Nov  2 20:56:49 2020"
```

```r
today<-Sys.Date()
print("Do we need code here?")
```

```
## [1] "Do we need code here?"
```

```r
print("what is date?")
```

```
## [1] "what is date?"
```

```r
print("Is it?") 
```

```
## [1] "Is it?"
```

```r
today
